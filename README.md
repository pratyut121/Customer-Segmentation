# Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company’s customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business.

### Need:

Targeted marketing activities to specific groups
Launch of features aligning with the customer demand
Development of the product roadmap

### RFM stands for Recency - Frequency - Monetary Value. 

Theoretically we will have segments like below:

Low Value: Customers who are less active than others, not very frequent buyer/visitor and generates very low - zero - maybe negative revenue.

Mid Value: In the middle of everything. Often using our platform (but not as much as our High Values), fairly frequent and generates moderate revenue.

High Value: The group we don’t want to lose. High Revenue, Frequency and low Inactivity.
